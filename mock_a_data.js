const questions=[{"q":"A marketing team wants to send a one-time promotional email with A/B testing on the subject line. Which program type should they use?","options":["Event Program","Email Program","Default Program","Engagement Program"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Email Program is the correct program type for one-time sends. It supports A/B testing on subject line, from name, and content. Event Programs are for events with dates, Engagement Programs are for nurture streams, and Default Programs are for non-email activities."},{"q":"Which program type would you use for a webinar scheduled for March 15th at 2:00 PM EST?","options":["Email Program","Event Program","Default Program","Engagement Program"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Event Programs are designed for time-based events like webinars, conferences, or seminars. They have a specific date/time and track attendance status (registered, attended, no-show). Email Programs are for one-time sends without a specific event date."},{"q":"A marketer wants to send a series of educational emails over 6 weeks to new trial users. Which program type is best?","options":["Email Program","Event Program","Engagement Program","Default Program with recurring batch campaign"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Engagement Programs are designed for nurture streams - series of emails sent over time based on cadence. They automatically manage the flow of content to leads. Email Programs are for one-time sends, not ongoing series."},{"q":"In an Email Program using Recipient Time Zone, the send is scheduled for 48 hours from now. What happens?","options":["Everyone receives email at correct local time","Email sends immediately","Email fails - need 25 hours minimum","Only some people receive at correct time"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When Recipient Time Zone is enabled and the program is approved at least 25 hours in advance, everyone receives the email at the correct local time. The 25-hour minimum ensures Marketo can calculate each recipient's local time and stagger sends accordingly."},{"q":"A marketer enables both Head Start and Recipient Time Zone for an Email Program. How many hours in advance must the program be approved?","options":["12 hours","25 hours","34 hours","48 hours"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When both Head Start (9 hours) and Recipient Time Zone (25 hours) are enabled, you need 9 + 25 = 34 hours minimum before the scheduled send time. Head Start sends early to top-performing segments first, then RTZ handles the rest by local timezone."},{"q":"Which A/B test winner criteria requires the test to run for at least 24 hours?","options":["Open Rate","Click Rate","Engagement Score","Click-to-Open Rate"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Engagement Score as a winner criteria requires the A/B test to run for at least 24 hours because it needs enough time to accumulate meaningful engagement data. Open Rate and Click Rate can be measured faster, but engagement scoring needs more time to be statistically significant."},{"q":"What is the difference between Channels and Tags in Marketo?","options":["There is no difference - they're the same","Channels are required; Tags are optional","Channels categorize program types; Tags are custom attributes for additional categorization","Tags are only for reporting"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Channels and Tags are both used to categorize programs, but they serve different purposes. Channels are required when creating a program and define the program type category. Tags are optional custom attributes you add for additional categorization and filtering in reports."},{"q":"Which reports support filtering by Channels and Tags?","options":["Email Performance Report","Program Performance Report","Landing Page Performance Report","People Performance Report"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Program Performance Report is the only report that supports filtering by both Channels and Tags. This allows you to compare performance across different program types and custom categories. Email Performance and Landing Page Performance reports focus on asset-level metrics."},{"q":"Period Costs should include which of the following? (Choose TWO)","options":["Pay-per-click advertising fees","Marketo subscription cost","Event venue rental","Full-time employee salaries"],"correct":[0,2],"multiple":true,"explanation":"Period Costs are ongoing costs associated with running a program during a specific time period. Pay-per-click advertising fees and event venue rental are period costs. Marketo subscription costs are company-wide, and employee salaries are overhead - neither are specific to a program period."},{"q":"What is the correct syntax for a My Token?","options":["`{my.eventDate}`","`[[my.eventDate]]`","`{{my.eventDate}}`","`${my.eventDate}`"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"My Tokens use double curly braces syntax: {{my.tokenName}}. Single curly braces {}, square brackets [[]], and dollar sign ${} are not valid Marketo token syntax. The 'my.' prefix indicates it's a custom My Token created at folder or program level."},{"q":"You have a token `{{my.region}}` set to \"EMEA\" at the folder level and \"AMER\" at the program level. An email in that program will display:","options":["EMEA","AMER","Both values","Error - duplicate tokens"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Marketo tokens follow a hierarchy: Program level overrides Folder level. Since {{my.region}} is set to 'AMER' at the program level, that value takes precedence over the folder-level 'EMEA'. This allows you to set defaults at folder level and override per program."},{"q":"Which token would display \"2025\" automatically?","options":["`{{lead.Year}}`","`{{system.dateYear}}`","`{{my.currentYear}}`","`{{company.Year}}`"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"{{system.dateYear}} is a system token that automatically returns the current year. System tokens are built-in and don't need to be created. {{lead.Year}} and {{company.Year}} are not valid system tokens, and {{my.currentYear}} would need to be manually maintained."},{"q":"To avoid showing `{{lead.First Name}}` when the field is empty, you should use:","options":["`{{lead.First Name=Friend}}`","`{{lead.First Name:default=Friend}}`","`{{lead.First Name||Friend}}`","`{{lead.First Name?Friend}}`"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The :default= syntax provides a fallback value when a lead field is empty. {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}} will show 'Friend' if the First Name field is blank. Without this, the raw token {{lead.First Name}} would appear in the email, which looks unprofessional."},{"q":"A person in an Engagement Program has received all content in their stream. What is their status?","options":["Completed","Exhausted","Finished","Done"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Exhausted' is the correct status term in Marketo for when a person has received all content in their Engagement Program stream. This is different from 'Completed' - a person can be exhausted but still in the program if new content is added later."},{"q":"What is the key difference between a Static List and a Smart List?","options":["Static Lists are faster","Static Lists are fixed; Smart Lists are dynamic","Smart Lists can't be used in campaigns","Static Lists are more accurate"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Static Lists are manually curated - you add/remove people manually or via import. Smart Lists are dynamic - they automatically update based on filter criteria you define. This is the fundamental difference between the two list types in Marketo."},{"q":"How do you remove a person from a Static List without deleting them from the database?","options":["Delete the person","Use \"Remove from List\" flow step","Unsubscribe the person","Set Marketing Suspended to True"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Remove from List' is a flow step in Smart Campaigns that removes a person from a Static List without deleting them from the database. The person still exists in Marketo, they just are no longer a member of that specific list."},{"q":"You imported a list and accidentally mapped Job Title to the Company field. How do you clear the incorrect values?","options":["Delete affected people and re-import","Change Data Value to \"BLANK\"","Change Data Value to \"NULL\"","Cannot be fixed"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"To clear incorrect field values after a bad import, use Change Data Value and set the value to empty string or NULL. Setting to 'BLANK' is not a valid option - you need to use an actual empty value. This clears the field without deleting the person record."},{"q":"Which Smart List operator would find people with job title \"Marketing Manager\" or \"Sales Manager\"?","options":["Job Title is \"Manager\"","Job Title starts with \"Manager\"","Job Title contains \"Manager\"","Job Title not is \"Director\""],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The 'contains' operator finds any value that includes the search term anywhere in the field. Since both 'Marketing Manager' and 'Sales Manager' contain the word 'Manager', using 'contains Manager' will match both. The 'is' operator requires an exact match."},{"q":"In a Segmentation, a person qualifies for multiple segments. Which segment will they be assigned to?","options":["All segments they qualify for","The first matching segment in order","The last matching segment","Random selection"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Segmentations are mutually exclusive - a person can only be in ONE segment. Marketo evaluates segments in order from top to bottom and assigns the person to the FIRST segment whose criteria they match. This is why segment order matters."},{"q":"What is the maximum number of segments allowed in a single Segmentation?","options":["10","50","100","200"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Marketo allows a maximum of 100 segments per Segmentation. This limit ensures performance stays optimal. Each segment can have complex filter criteria, so 100 is a generous limit for most use cases."},{"q":"Which System Smart List shows everyone in your database?","options":["All Leads","All Contacts","All People","Everyone"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'All People' is the System Smart List that contains every person in your Marketo database. 'All Leads' and 'All Contacts' are Salesforce terminology, not Marketo. Marketo unified the concept into 'People' (previously called 'Leads' in older versions)."},{"q":"A person has \"Blocklisted = True\". What emails can they receive?","options":["Marketing emails only","Operational emails only","All emails","No emails at all"],"correct":[3],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When Blocklisted = True, the person cannot receive ANY emails - neither marketing nor operational. This is the most restrictive status. Unlike Marketing Suspended (which still allows operational emails), Blocklisted blocks everything completely."},{"q":"A person is \"Marketing Suspended = True\". What can they receive?","options":["No emails","Operational emails only","Marketing emails only","All emails"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Marketing Suspended = True blocks marketing emails but still allows operational emails (like order confirmations, password resets). This is useful when a person opts out of marketing communications but still needs to receive important transactional emails."},{"q":"Which list import type would you use if you want to ONLY update existing records without creating new ones?","options":["New People and Updates","New People Only","Update People Only","List Member Only"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Update People Only' updates existing records based on email match but does NOT create new records for unmatched entries. This is useful when you want to enrich existing data without accidentally creating duplicate or new records."},{"q":"Which import type is fastest when you just need to add people to a list?","options":["New People and Updates","New People Only","Update People Only","List Member Only"],"correct":[3],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'List Member Only' is the fastest import type because it simply adds people to a list without creating new records or updating any fields. It only requires an email address to match against existing records. Perfect when you just need to populate a list."},{"q":"What field does Marketo use to match existing records during import?","options":["First Name","Last Name","Email Address","Company"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Marketo uses Email Address as the primary matching field during imports. This is the unique identifier in Marketo - if an imported email matches an existing record, it updates that record instead of creating a duplicate."},{"q":"A Segmentation has these segments in order:","options":["Enterprise","Mid-Market","Default","None"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Segments are evaluated top to bottom, and a person is assigned to the FIRST matching segment. A company with 500 employees matches 'Mid-Market (>100)' but not 'Enterprise (>1000)'. Since Enterprise is checked first and doesn't match, Mid-Market is the correct assignment."},{"q":"Which of the following can use Segmentations for filtering? (Choose TWO)","options":["Dynamic Content in Emails","Smart Campaign Smart Lists","Program Performance Report","Email Performance Report"],"correct":[0,2],"multiple":true,"explanation":"Dynamic Content in Emails and Program Performance Report can both use Segmentations for filtering. Dynamic Content uses Segmentations to show different content to different segments. Smart Campaign Smart Lists use filters/triggers, not Segmentations directly."},{"q":"Where are Global assets created?","options":["Marketing Activities","Database","Design Studio","Analytics"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Global assets (emails, forms, landing pages, snippets) are created in Design Studio. Design Studio is the asset management area in Marketo where you build and manage reusable templates and components that can be used across multiple programs."},{"q":"You try to add a form to a landing page but get an error. What's the most likely reason?","options":["Form is too long","Form is in Draft status","Landing page is approved","Form is global"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Forms must be in 'Approved' status to be added to a landing page. If you get an error trying to add a form, check its status - if it's still in Draft, you need to approve it first. Only approved assets can be actively used in campaigns."},{"q":"What happens when you edit an approved email?","options":["Changes go live immediately","A draft is created; changes don't go live until you approve the draft","Email becomes unapproved","Email is locked and cannot be edited"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When you edit an approved email, Marketo creates a draft version automatically. The original approved version remains active for any scheduled sends. Your changes only go live when you explicitly approve the new draft version. This prevents accidental changes to live emails."},{"q":"Form Pre-Fill works in which scenario?","options":["Form on Marketo landing page with known visitor","Form embedded on external website","Form in email","Form Pre-Fill works in all scenarios"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Form Pre-Fill only works on Marketo landing pages when the visitor is a known lead (previously filled out a form or clicked a tracked link). It does NOT work on external websites or forms embedded outside of Marketo landing pages."},{"q":"Progressive Profiling is used to:","options":["Make forms load faster","Show different questions to returning visitors","Validate email addresses","Block spam submissions"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Progressive Profiling shows different form fields to returning visitors based on what data you already have. First visit might ask for name and email; second visit asks for job title and company size. This gradually builds a complete profile without overwhelming the visitor."},{"q":"What feature allows you to show/hide form fields based on answers to previous questions?","options":["Progressive Profiling","Visibility Rules","Form Pre-Fill","Mask Input"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Visibility Rules allow you to show or hide specific form fields based on answers to other questions on the same form. For example, if someone selects 'Enterprise' as company size, additional enterprise-specific fields can appear dynamically."},{"q":"Global Form Validation Rules are used to:","options":["Make fields required","Block specific email domains from form submission","Set up progressive profiling","Enable CAPTCHA"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Global Form Validation Rules let you block specific email domains (like gmail.com, yahoo.com) from ALL forms in your Marketo instance at once. This is a global setting that applies everywhere, saving you from having to set it up on each form individually."},{"q":"What is the key difference between Marketing and Operational emails?","options":["Marketing emails are cheaper","Operational emails bypass Unsubscribed and Marketing Suspended status","Marketing emails track better","Operational emails are faster"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Operational emails bypass both Unsubscribed and Marketing Suspended status. This is critical because operational emails (order confirmations, password resets, shipping notifications) MUST be delivered regardless of marketing preferences. Marketing emails respect both statuses."},{"q":"Which is an appropriate use of an Operational email?","options":["Monthly newsletter","Product promotion","Order confirmation","Webinar invitation"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Order confirmations and shipping notifications are transactional/operational communications that customers expect and need to receive. They are not promotional in nature, making them appropriate for Operational email classification in Marketo."},{"q":"Why can't opens be tracked for Text Only emails?","options":["Text emails don't have links","Opens are tracked via invisible image pixel; Text Only has no images","Text emails are too small","Tracking is disabled by law"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Opens are tracked using an invisible 1x1 pixel image embedded in HTML emails. When the email is opened and images load, the pixel registers a 'open' event. Text Only emails have no HTML and therefore no images, making open tracking impossible."},{"q":"What is a Preheader in an email?","options":["The email header with logo","Summary text after subject line in inbox preview","First paragraph of email","From name"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"A Preheader (also called preview text) is the short text that appears after the subject line in most email clients' inbox view. It gives recipients a preview of the email content and is a valuable tool for improving open rates. It's set in the email header settings."},{"q":"What is the primary benefit of using Snippets?","options":["Faster email sends","Update content once and it changes everywhere it's used","Better deliverability","Higher open rates"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Snippets are reusable content blocks. The key benefit is that when you update a snippet, the changes automatically appear everywhere that snippet is used. This saves enormous time when you need to update content across many emails simultaneously."},{"q":"A marketer edits a global snippet used in 50 emails. What happens after approving the snippet?","options":["Nothing - must update each email manually","All 50 emails now show updated snippet content","Only future sends show updated content","Emails must be re-approved"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Global Snippets update everywhere they are used automatically upon approval. No need to re-approve individual emails. The snippet content is loaded dynamically, so all 50 emails will show the updated content on their next send without any additional action."},{"q":"What must you create BEFORE using Dynamic Content in an email?","options":["A My Token","A Smart List","A Segmentation","A Static List"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"You must create an approved Segmentation BEFORE you can use Dynamic Content. Dynamic Content relies on Segmentations to determine which content variation to show to each person. Without an approved Segmentation, the Dynamic Content option won't be available."},{"q":"In a Segmentation used for Dynamic Content, can a person be in multiple segments?","options":["Yes, all segments they qualify for","No, only ONE segment","Yes, maximum 3 segments","Depends on settings"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Segmentations are mutually exclusive by design - each person can only belong to ONE segment within a Segmentation. This ensures Dynamic Content shows exactly one variation per person, not conflicting combinations of content."},{"q":"Which elements can have Dynamic Content in an email? (Choose THREE)","options":["Text modules","Images","Snippets","Forms"],"correct":[0,1,2],"multiple":true,"explanation":"Text modules, Images, and Snippets can all have Dynamic Content applied in Marketo emails. Forms CANNOT have Dynamic Content based on Segmentations - forms use Visibility Rules instead for dynamic behavior."},{"q":"A person doesn't match any specific segment criteria. What content do they see?","options":["No content - email fails","Random segment content","Default segment content","First segment content"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When a person doesn't match any specific segment criteria, they see the Default segment content. Every Segmentation should have a Default segment as a catch-all to ensure all visitors see appropriate content, even if they don't match any specific criteria."},{"q":"Can Marketo forms be made dynamic using Segmentations?","options":["Yes, exactly like emails","No, use Visibility Rules instead","Yes, but only global forms","Yes, but only local forms"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Marketo forms cannot use Segmentation-based Dynamic Content like emails and landing pages can. For dynamic form behavior, you should use Visibility Rules instead, which show/hide fields based on form answers or lead data."},{"q":"Before sending an email with dynamic content, what's the critical QA step?","options":["Send test to yourself","Preview by Segment for ALL segments","Check spelling","Verify unsubscribe link"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Before sending an email with Dynamic Content, you MUST preview it by Segment - checking every single segment variation. This ensures each audience sees the correct, properly formatted content. Missing even one segment could result in broken or inappropriate content being sent."},{"q":"What types of content can be added to an Engagement Program stream? (Choose TWO)","options":["Emails","Default Programs","Email Programs","Landing Pages"],"correct":[0,1],"multiple":true,"explanation":"Engagement Program streams can contain Emails and Default Programs (which can include events, webinars, etc.). Email Programs and Landing Pages cannot be added directly to streams. The stream sequences these content pieces according to the cadence you define."},{"q":"A marketer has an approved landing page with a global form. They edit and approve the form. What must they do to the landing page?","options":["Re-approve the landing page","Create draft of landing page","Nothing - it auto-updates","Clone the landing page"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Global forms auto-update across all landing pages where they are used. When you edit and approve a global form, the changes immediately apply to all 10 landing pages without any action on the landing pages. This is one of the key advantages of using global assets."},{"q":"What is the key difference between Batch and Trigger campaigns?","options":["Batch is faster","Batch uses filters only; Trigger has at least one trigger","Triggers can't have filters","Batch can't send emails"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"A Smart Campaign is Batch if it has ONLY filters (no triggers). It becomes a Trigger campaign as soon as at least one trigger is added. Filters define WHO qualifies, triggers define WHEN they qualify. Batch runs on a schedule; Trigger runs in real-time."},{"q":"A Smart Campaign has:","options":["Filter: Lead Score > 50","Trigger: Fills Out Form","Batch","Trigger","Both","Neither"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Even though the campaign has a filter (Lead Score > 50), the presence of a trigger (Fills Out Form) makes it a Trigger campaign. The filter acts as an additional qualification criteria - the person must BOTH fill out the form AND have a score > 50."},{"q":"Which finds people who clicked an email in the PAST?","options":["Clicks Link in Email (trigger)","Clicked Link in Email (filter)","Will Click Link","Link Click Activity"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Clicked Link' (past tense) is a filter - it finds people who clicked in the past. 'Clicks Link' (present tense) is a trigger - it fires in real-time when someone clicks. This tense difference is a common exam trick in Marketo certification tests."},{"q":"Which flow step would you use to notify sales when a hot lead requests a demo?","options":["Send Email","Send Alert","Create Task","Change Owner"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Send Alert' is the correct flow step for notifying sales teams. It sends an email alert to a specified person (like a sales rep) with details about the lead. 'Send Email' sends to the lead, 'Create Task' creates a CRM task, and 'Change Owner' reassigns the lead."},{"q":"For Request Campaign to work, the called campaign must have what in its Smart List?","options":["Filled Out Form","Campaign is Requested","Member of List","Any trigger"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"For Request Campaign to work, the CALLED campaign's Smart List must include the trigger 'Campaign is Requested'. This is what tells Marketo to run that campaign when it receives the request. Without this trigger, the Request Campaign flow step won't activate the called campaign."},{"q":"What does \"Remove from Flow\" do?","options":["Deletes person from database","Immediately stops flow execution for that person","Removes person from list","Unsubscribes person"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Remove from Flow' immediately stops a person's progression through the current flow. They won't execute any remaining flow steps. It does NOT delete them, remove them from lists, or unsubscribe them - it simply stops their current flow execution."},{"q":"What is the MAXIMUM wait time for a Wait Step?","options":["90 days","365 days","730 days (2 years)","Unlimited"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The maximum wait time for a Wait Step in Marketo is 730 days (2 years). This is a hard limit set by the platform. For longer waits, you would need to chain multiple Wait Steps together or use a different automation approach."},{"q":"You have `Wait until {{lead.Trial End Date}}`. The trial ended yesterday. What happens?","options":["Wait fails","Waits until next occurrence","Continues immediately","Person removed from flow"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When a Wait Step uses a date token and that date has already passed, Marketo doesn't wait - the flow continues immediately. The logic is: if the wait-until date is in the past, there's nothing to wait for, so execution proceeds to the next step."},{"q":"What happens to people in Wait Steps if you DEACTIVATE a trigger campaign?","options":["They complete normally","They're removed","They stop processing and remain in wait","They get error notification"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When you deactivate a trigger campaign, people currently in Wait Steps stop processing and remain stuck in their wait state. They do NOT complete the flow or get removed. You would need to reactivate the campaign for them to continue, or manually handle them."},{"q":"A campaign's qualification rule is \"Once every 7 days\". A person qualifies Monday and Wednesday. What happens?","options":["Runs both times","Only runs Monday","Only runs Wednesday","Error"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"With 'Once every 7 days' qualification, after a person qualifies on Monday, they cannot qualify again until the following Monday. Wednesday falls within the 7-day cooldown period, so the person is skipped. This prevents over-communication."},{"q":"Default qualification rule for smart campaigns is:","options":["Every time","Once per person","Once every 7 days","Once per month"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The default qualification rule in Marketo Smart Campaigns is 'Once per person' - meaning each person can only go through the campaign once, ever. You can change this to 'Every time', 'Once every X days', or set specific dates."},{"q":"How is Email Open Rate calculated?","options":["Opens ÷ Sent","Opens ÷ Delivered × 100%","Opens ÷ Total Members","Opens ÷ Clicks"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Email Open Rate = Opens ÷ Delivered × 100%. It's calculated against Delivered (not Sent) because bounced emails were never actually delivered and therefore could never be opened. This gives a more accurate picture of engagement among people who actually received the email."},{"q":"What's the difference between Click Rate and Click-to-Open Rate?","options":["They're the same","Click Rate = Clicks ÷ Delivered; Click-to-Open = Clicks ÷ Opens","Click-to-Open includes bounces","Click Rate is always higher"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Click Rate = Clicks ÷ Delivered. Click-to-Open Rate = Clicks ÷ Opens. Click-to-Open Rate is more meaningful for measuring content engagement because it shows what percentage of people who actually opened the email then clicked something inside it."},{"q":"In Program Performance Report, how is \"Cost per Success\" calculated?","options":["Total Cost ÷ Total Members","Total Cost ÷ New Names","Total Cost ÷ Success","Total Revenue ÷ Success"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Cost per Success = Total Cost ÷ Number of Successes. This metric tells you how much it costs to achieve one successful outcome (like a registration or conversion). Lower is better. It helps compare the efficiency of different programs."},{"q":"Which report shows how many people are currently in Wait Steps?","options":["Program Performance","Campaign Activity","Email Performance","People Performance"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Campaign Activity Report shows real-time campaign status including how many people are currently in Wait Steps, which flow steps they're on, and overall campaign progress. This is different from Program Performance which shows aggregate results."},{"q":"Can Web Page Activity Report show both Known and Anonymous visitors in the same report?","options":["Yes, both together","No, must choose one or the other","Yes, but only premium accounts","Only for external pages"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Web Page Activity Report requires you to choose either Known or Anonymous visitors - you cannot see both in the same report. Known visitors are identified leads; Anonymous are unidentified visitors. Each view serves a different analytical purpose."},{"q":"What does \"Engagement Score\" measure in Engagement Stream Performance Report?","options":["Person's interest level","Content performance (0-100)","Stream popularity","Send frequency"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Engagement Score in the Engagement Stream Performance Report measures content performance on a scale of 0-100. It factors in opens, clicks, and other engagement signals to give each piece of content a score, helping you optimize your nurture stream content."},{"q":"A marketer needs to receive a list every Friday of people who unsubscribed in the past 7 days. What should they create?","options":["Report Subscription","Smart List Subscription","Recurring Email Program","Manual export"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Smart List Subscription is what you need here. It sends you a list of people matching Smart List criteria on a recurring schedule. Report Subscription sends metric reports, not lists of people. This lets sales teams get weekly lists of unsubscribes automatically."},{"q":"What's the difference between Report Subscription and Smart List Subscription?","options":["No difference","Report = metrics; Smart List = list of people","Report is faster","Smart List is more accurate"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Report Subscription sends metric/analytics data (like performance numbers), while Smart List Subscription sends an actual list of people matching criteria. They serve different purposes - one for reporting, one for getting actionable people lists."},{"q":"In what formats can Report Subscriptions be sent? (Choose THREE)","options":["Excel","CSV","PDF","Word"],"correct":[0,1,2],"multiple":true,"explanation":"Report Subscriptions can be sent in Excel, CSV, and PDF formats. Word is not a supported format for report subscriptions. These three formats cover the most common needs: Excel/CSV for data manipulation, PDF for sharing formatted reports."},{"q":"You schedule a monthly subscription for the 31st. What happens in February?","options":["Skips February","Sends on last day of February","Sends March 31st instead","Error occurs"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When you schedule a subscription for the 31st and a month doesn't have 31 days (like February), Marketo sends it on the last day of that month instead. So February would receive it on the 28th (or 29th in leap years). No month is skipped."}];
