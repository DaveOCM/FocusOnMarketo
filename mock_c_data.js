const questions=[{"q":"Scenario: Annual conference with 500 attendees. Need to track registration, attendance, and post-event survey. Which program type?","options":["Email Program","Event Program","Default Program","Engagement Program"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Event Program is the correct choice for conferences. It tracks event-specific statuses like registration and attendance, has a specific date/time, and supports ROI tracking. It's designed exactly for this scenario - a time-based event with multiple status milestones."},{"q":"Scenario: Sending monthly newsletter to 50,000 subscribers. Need to test 3 different subject lines. Best approach?","options":["Send 3 separate emails","Use Email Program with A/B test (can only test 2)","Use 3 Email Programs","Use Engagement Program"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Email Program supports A/B testing, but Marketo only allows testing 2 variations at a time (not 3 simultaneously). To test 3 subject lines, you would need to run sequential A/B tests or use a different approach. Each A/B test within an Email Program supports up to 2 variations."},{"q":"Scenario: Trial users should receive Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, and Day 28 emails. Best program type?","options":["6 separate Email Programs","Default Program with smart campaigns and wait steps","Engagement Program","Event Program with reminders"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Engagement Program is the correct choice for drip campaigns with a set sequence of emails over time. It manages the cadence automatically, tracks where each person is in the sequence, and handles exhausted status when all content has been delivered."},{"q":"You need to send an email tomorrow at 9 AM to 25,000 people worldwide. Want everyone to receive it at 9 AM their local time. Minimum approval time needed?","options":["12 hours (Head Start)","24 hours","25 hours (Recipient Time Zone requirement)","No minimum if not using features"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"To send at 9 AM local time worldwide, you need Recipient Time Zone enabled. However, you must approve the program at least 25 hours before the send time. If sending tomorrow at 9 AM, you need to approve it now (more than 25 hours ahead) for RTZ to work properly."},{"q":"Channel \"Webinar\" has statuses: Invited (10pts), Registered (25pts), Attended (50pts - Success), No Show (0pts). A person registers but doesn't attend. Their program status score?","options":["0","10","25","50"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Channel status points are used to calculate program success and ROI. 'Attended' is marked as Success (indicated by the asterisk or success flag) because attending the webinar is the ultimate goal. Points accumulate as people progress through statuses."},{"q":"You have 3 tags: Region (AMER/EMEA/APAC), Product (A/B/C), Owner (Person1/Person2/Person3). One program can have how many tag values total?","options":["1 total","3 total (one per tag type)","Unlimited","Maximum 5"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Using multiple tags (Region, Product, Owner) creates a powerful multi-dimensional categorization system. You can filter Program Performance reports by any combination of these tags. For example, filter by Region=AMER AND Product=A to see performance for that specific segment."},{"q":"Event costs $15,000 total (venue, catering, materials). Generated 50 leads. Cost per New Name?","options":["$150","$300","$750","Cannot calculate without success data"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Cost per New Name = Total Cost ÷ New Names. $15,000 ÷ 50 = $300 per new lead. This metric is crucial for evaluating marketing ROI and comparing the efficiency of different programs in acquiring new prospects for your pipeline."},{"q":"Folder token: `{{my.productName}}` = \"Widget Pro\"","options":["Both work: \"Widget Pro\" and \"$99\"","Only program token works","Only folder token works","Error - too many tokens"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Program-level tokens override folder-level tokens. Since the program sets {{my.productName}} to 'Widget Elite', that value is used in all assets within that program, regardless of what the folder-level token says. This hierarchy allows broad defaults with program-specific overrides."},{"q":"Email subject: \"{{lead.First Name}}, don't miss {{my.offerName}}!\"","options":["\"don't miss 50% Off!\"","\"{{lead.First Name}}, don't miss 50% Off!\"","\"Friend, don't miss 50% Off!\"","Email fails to send"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When both lead tokens and My Tokens are used in the same email subject, they work independently. Lead tokens pull from individual lead data (personalized per recipient), while My Tokens pull from program/folder settings (same for all recipients in that program)."},{"q":"Communication limits: 3 emails/week (Sun-Sat). Person received 3 marketing emails Tuesday-Thursday. Friday, marketer sends operational email. Result?","options":["Blocked by limits","Sends (operational bypass limits)","Queues for next week","Requires override"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Communication limits reset on a weekly basis (Sunday to Saturday). If the person already received 3 marketing emails this week (Tuesday-Thursday), any additional marketing emails are blocked until next Sunday. Operational emails are NOT affected by communication limits."},{"q":"Engagement Program with Weekly cadence, Wednesdays at 10 AM. Person added Monday. When do they receive first email?","options":["Immediately (Monday)","Next cast (Wednesday 10 AM)","Following week Wednesday","Depends on settings"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"With weekly cadence on Wednesdays at 10 AM, the first cast happens on the next Wednesday after the person is added. Since they were added on Monday, they receive their first content the following Wednesday at 10 AM. The cadence schedule determines when content is delivered."},{"q":"Stream has 5 emails. Person received emails 1-4. Email 5 is unapproved (draft). Next cast happens. What does person receive?","options":["Email 5 draft version","Nothing (exhausted - can't send draft)","Email 1 again (restarts)","Error notification"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When the next email in the stream is unapproved (draft), Marketo skips it and waits. The person does not receive email 5 until it's approved. They remain in their current position in the stream - no content is skipped permanently, just delayed until approval."},{"q":"Program cloned 3 times for different regions. Each needs unique {{my.phone}} token. Best approach?","options":["Edit token in each program individually","Create 3 different folders with folder-level tokens","Can't have same token name with different values","Use lead tokens instead"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Each cloned program gets its own copy of My Tokens. You update {{my.phone}} independently in each regional program. This is the main advantage of program-level tokens - each program instance can have unique values while sharing the same token name structure."},{"q":"A/B test: 20,000 recipients, test 15% sample, 2 subject lines. Winner declared at 4 hours. When can remaining 17,000 receive email?","options":["Immediately at 4 hours","Minimum 8 hours total (4 hrs test + 4 hrs gap)","Next day","Manual send required"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"With 20,000 recipients and 15% test sample, 3,000 people (1,500 per variation) receive the test. The winner is declared after 4 hours based on the specified metric. The remaining 17,000 recipients then receive the winning variation. Test sample % balances speed vs. statistical significance."},{"q":"Scenario: Sales provides Excel with 200 hot leads. Need to import and send immediate email. Best import type?","options":["List Member Only (fastest, just add to list)","New People and Updates","New People Only","Update People Only"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"For immediate action on imported leads, use 'New People and Updates' import type to create the records, then use a trigger-based Smart Campaign that fires when people are added to the import list. This ensures the email goes out immediately after import completes."},{"q":"Scenario: Vendor provides enriched data for 5,000 existing leads (job titles, company size). Don't want new records. Import type?","options":["New People and Updates","New People Only","Update People Only","List Member Only"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Update People Only' is correct because the vendor is enriching EXISTING leads - not creating new ones. This import type updates fields on existing records matched by email without creating any new records. Perfect for data enrichment scenarios."},{"q":"Smart List: Lead Score > 50 AND (State = \"CA\" OR State = \"NY\" OR State = \"TX\"). How many people would match if 1,000 have Score > 50 total, 300 in CA, 200 in NY, 100 in TX, 400 in other states?","options":["1,000","600 (CA + NY + TX)","600 (those with Score > 50 AND in CA/NY/TX)","300"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The Smart List logic requires Lead Score > 50 AND at least one of the state conditions. The AND/OR structure means both conditions must be evaluated: the score filter AND the state group (where any of the three states qualifies). The exact count depends on your data."},{"q":"Segmentation \"Lead Score Tier\": Hot (>75), Warm (>50), Cold (0-50), Default. Person has score 60. Which segment?","options":["Hot","Warm","Cold","Default"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Segmentations evaluate top to bottom. With score 60: Hot requires >75 (no match), Warm requires >50 (MATCH). Person is assigned to Warm segment. They never reach Cold or Default because Warm matched first. This is why segment order is critical."},{"q":"Person has: Unsubscribed=False, Marketing Suspended=True, Blocklisted=False. They can receive:","options":["All emails","No emails","Marketing emails only","Operational emails only"],"correct":[3],"multiple":false,"explanation":"With Marketing Suspended=True, the person can ONLY receive Operational emails. Marketing emails are blocked, but operational emails (order confirmations, password resets) still go through. Blocklisted=False means they aren't fully blocked, just marketing-suspended."},{"q":"Company policy: No emails to @gmail, @yahoo, @hotmail. Where to configure?","options":["Each form individually","Each smart campaign","Global Form Validation Rules (Admin)","Email settings"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Global Form Validation Rules is the correct place to block specific email domains company-wide. Configure it in Admin > Form Settings. This applies the block to ALL forms automatically - you don't need to set it up on each form individually."},{"q":"Smart List takes 10 minutes to process. How to speed up? (Choose TWO)","options":["Use \"Member of List\" filter (indexed)","Reduce \"contains\" text searches","Add more filters","Run at night"],"correct":[0,1],"multiple":true,"explanation":"To speed up Smart List processing: (1) Reduce filter complexity - simpler filters process faster, and (2) Use more specific filters to narrow the result set earlier. Overly complex nested logic or very broad filters can slow down processing significantly."},{"q":"Segmentation has 10 segments. Person doesn't match any. Result?","options":["Error","Random assignment","Goes to Default segment","Not assigned to any segment"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When a person doesn't match any segment in a Segmentation, they fall into the Default segment. Every Segmentation should have a Default segment as a catch-all. If there's no Default segment, the person sees no dynamic content variation (which could result in blank content)."},{"q":"Field \"Country\" has values: \"USA\", \"United States\", \"US\", \"U.S.A\". Best solution?","options":["Leave as-is (diversity)","Use Smart Campaign to normalize all to \"United States\"","Create 4 different countries","Block future submissions"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The best solution for inconsistent field values is data normalization - using a Smart Campaign with Change Data Value to standardize all variations to one consistent value (e.g., 'United States'). This cleans up historical data and ensures consistent targeting going forward."},{"q":"Import 1,000 records. 800 already exist (matched by email), 200 new. Import type \"New People Only\" will create:","options":["1,000 records (all)","200 records (new only)","800 records (existing only)","0 records (conflicts)"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'New People and Updates' imports both new records AND updates existing ones. With this type: 800 existing records get updated with any new field data, and 200 new records are created. This is the most common import type for mixed lists."},{"q":"Static List created Jan 1 with 500 people. Today (Feb 1), 100 more people meet same criteria. Static List has:","options":["500 (doesn't auto-update)","600 (auto-updates)","100 (replaces old)","0 (expired)"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Static Lists are fixed snapshots - they don't automatically update. The list still has exactly 500 people from January 1st. The 100 new people who now meet the criteria are NOT automatically added. You would need to re-run the Smart List and manually add them."},{"q":"Need to find people who opened ANY email in past 30 days. Filter?","options":["Opened Email, in past 30 days","Clicked Link in Email, in past 30 days","Was Sent Email, in past 30 days","Email Performance > 0"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Use filter 'Opened Email' with date range 'in the last 30 days'. This finds anyone who opened any email within the past 30 days. The 'any' qualifier means it matches regardless of which specific email was opened - any email open counts."},{"q":"Segmentation approved Monday. Tuesday, need to add new segment. Process?","options":["Add directly (always editable)","Unapprove → Add segment → Re-approve","Clone segmentation","Contact support"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"To add a new segment to an approved Segmentation: create a draft of the Segmentation, add the new segment, then approve. The current approved version remains active until you approve the updated draft. This prevents disruption to active Dynamic Content."},{"q":"Database has 100,000 people. System Smart List \"All People\" shows:","options":["100,000","Only marketable people","Only known people","Recently active only"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'All People' System Smart List shows ALL 100,000 people in your database regardless of any status - including unsubscribed, blocklisted, or inactive records. It's a complete view of your entire database, not filtered by any criteria."},{"q":"Approved email used in active campaign. Create draft, make edits. Campaign immediately:","options":["Uses new draft","Breaks (email in draft)","Continues using last approved version","Requires re-approval"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The campaign continues using the currently approved email version. Creating a draft does NOT affect active campaigns - they keep using the approved version. Your edits only go live when you explicitly approve the new draft. Active campaigns are never disrupted by drafts."},{"q":"Form on Marketo LP, known visitor. Fields: Email, FirstName, LastName, Company. Visitor already has First/Last/Company. Pre-Fill shows:","options":["All 4 fields filled","Only Email (hidden fields don't pre-fill)","None (security)","Email, First, Last, Company (all visible fields)"],"correct":[3],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Form Pre-Fill fills in known fields automatically. Since the visitor already has Email, FirstName, LastName, and Company on file, ALL four fields are pre-filled. The visitor sees a form with those fields already populated - they can edit or just submit."},{"q":"Progressive Profiling: Always show Email. Pool has 10 fields, set to show 2 progressive. First-time visitor sees:","options":["Email only","Email + 2 progressive (total 3)","2 progressive only","All 10 fields"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Progressive Profiling always shows Email (as specified). From the pool of 10 fields, 2 progressive fields are shown. Since FirstName and LastName are already filled, the next 2 unfilled fields from the pool are displayed. Email is always shown regardless of progressive settings."},{"q":"Form Visibility Rule: Show \"US State\" field IF Country = \"United States\". Person selects \"Canada\". State field:","options":["Stays visible","Hides immediately (dynamic)","Shows but optional","Grays out"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Visibility Rules work in real-time. When the person selects 'United Kingdom', the rule 'Show US State IF Country = United States' evaluates to false. The US State field is hidden immediately. If they change country back to US, the field reappears dynamically."},{"q":"Global snippet \"Footer\" used in 100 emails. Edit approved snippet (create draft). 100 emails show:","options":["New draft immediately","Old approved version until snippet draft approved","Error (can't edit global)","Must update emails individually"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When you edit an approved snippet (creating a draft), the 100 emails continue showing the currently approved snippet content. The draft changes are NOT visible anywhere until you approve the new snippet version. This protects live content stability."},{"q":"Dynamic Content: Email to 10,000 people in 3 segments (AMER=6000, EMEA=3000, APAC=1000). All segments configured. Default not configured. Result?","options":["Email fails","Error for people without specific segment","No people should hit Default if all in segments (but best practice is always configure Default)","Random content shown"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"With 3 segments: AMER (6000), EMEA (3000), APAC (1000). Each segment sees its own dynamic content variation. The 6000 AMER people see AMER content, 3000 EMEA people see EMEA content, 1000 APAC people see APAC content. All 10,000 receive the email but with personalized variations."},{"q":"Segmentation \"Region\": AMER (#1), Global (#2), Default (#3). Person in Brazil matches \"Global\" (Country not empty). They get:","options":["AMER","Global (first match)","Default","No segment"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Segments are evaluated top to bottom. Brazil doesn't match AMER (#1), but matches Global (#2) because Global includes all regions not in AMER. Person is assigned to Global. They never reach Default because Global matched first."},{"q":"Email: Operational=Yes, Unsubscribed person receives:","options":["No (operational respects unsubscribe)","Yes (operational bypasses unsubscribe)","Only if re-subscribes","Requires admin override"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Operational emails bypass unsubscribe status. Since the email is marked as Operational=Yes, the unsubscribed person WILL receive it. This is by design - operational emails like order confirmations must be delivered regardless of marketing preferences."},{"q":"Preheader text set to \"Join us for our biggest sale!\" but shows `{{lead.FirstName}}` in inbox. Problem?","options":["Preheader doesn't support tokens","Token has no default value and field is empty","Email client doesn't support preheader","Need to approve email"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The preheader showing a raw token means the token {{lead.FirstName}} is not being resolved. This could be because the field is empty for some recipients, or the token syntax is incorrect in the preheader settings. Always use :default= syntax in preheaders to handle empty fields."},{"q":"Snippet vs Token for event details (date, time, location, agenda with formatting):","options":["Use Token (simpler)","Use Snippet (supports rich formatting)","Either works the same","Use both combined"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Snippets are better than tokens for event details with formatting. Snippets support full HTML formatting (tables, colors, layouts), while My Tokens are plain text or simple HTML. For complex formatted content like event agendas, Snippets provide the flexibility needed."},{"q":"Landing page approved and live. Form on page is draft. Visitor tries to submit:","options":["Works fine","Error (form must be approved)","Submission queues until form approved","Page shows as draft"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"If the form on the landing page is in Draft status, visitors cannot submit it. Even though the landing page is approved, a draft form is not functional. The form must be approved before it can accept submissions. This is a common gotcha in Marketo."},{"q":"Engagement Program stream has: Email A, Email B, Default Program C, Email D. Order matters because:","options":["Doesn't matter (random)","Sends top-to-bottom, skips what person already received","All send simultaneously","Order only matters for programs"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Content order in Engagement streams matters - it determines the sequence each person receives. Email A first, then B, then Program C, then D. Each person progresses through in this exact order based on the cadence. Reordering changes the nurture sequence for everyone."},{"q":"Person in Engagement: Stream 1 (Awareness). Clicked 5 links. Smart Campaign: If clicks >=3, change to Stream 2 (Consideration). Next cast:","options":["Receives from Stream 1 (hasn't transitioned yet)","Receives from Stream 2 (already transitioned)","Receives from both","Skips (in transition)"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The person's high engagement (5 clicks) triggers the Smart Campaign, which moves them to Stream 2 (Consideration). This demonstrates how Smart Campaigns can dynamically reroute people between Engagement streams based on their behavior - a key feature for progressive nurturing."},{"q":"Engagement Program cadence: Weekly, Wednesdays 2PM. Person added Friday. When's first cast?","options":["Immediately","Next Wednesday 2PM","Following Wednesday","Manual qualification needed"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"With weekly cadence on Wednesdays at 2PM, the first cast is the following Wednesday. Since the person was added on Friday, they wait until next Wednesday at 2PM for their first content delivery. The cadence schedule is fixed and doesn't adjust based on when someone is added."},{"q":"Email uses dynamic content with \"Industry\" segmentation. Person's Industry field = empty. They see:","options":["No content (error)","Default segment content","Random segment","Email blocked"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When a person's Industry field is empty, they don't match any specific segment criteria and fall into the Default segment. They see the Default content variation. This is why having a well-crafted Default segment is important - it's the fallback for unmatched leads."},{"q":"Form embedded on external website (yoursite.com, not Marketo). Known visitor. Pre-Fill:","options":["Works normally","Doesn't work (security - only works on Marketo LPs)","Works if HTTPS","Requires SSL certificate"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Form Pre-Fill does NOT work on external websites. It only works on Marketo-hosted landing pages. Even though the visitor is known, the external site cannot access Marketo's lead data to pre-fill fields. This is a key limitation to understand."},{"q":"CAPTCHA enabled on form. Bot submits with low score. Result:","options":["Submission blocked","Submission accepted, score recorded in activity","Requires manual review","CAPTCHA shows puzzle"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"CAPTCHA blocks submissions that score below the threshold. Bot submissions are automatically rejected - no record is created in Marketo. This protects your database from spam and keeps your data quality high for marketing automation."},{"q":"Asset status \"Approved with Draft\". Meaning:","options":["Approved version is live, draft exists but not live","Both versions live","Draft will auto-approve","Needs manual merge"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Approved with Draft' means there is a currently approved version being used in active campaigns, AND someone has also created a draft with pending changes. The approved version remains active; the draft is waiting to be reviewed and approved separately."},{"q":"Operational email subject: \"Your Order #{{lead.Order Number}} Has Shipped\". Order Number field empty. Shows:","options":["\"Your Order Has Shipped\"","\"Your Order #{{lead.Order Number}} Has Shipped\"","Error (can't send)","\"Your Order #[EMPTY] Has Shipped\""],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When a token field is empty (Order Number is blank), the raw token {{lead.Order Number}} appears in the email as literal text. For operational emails, this is a critical issue - always use fallback values or validate data before sending. Consider using :default= syntax."},{"q":"Email sent to 5,000. Uses snippet. Next day, edit snippet, approve changes. Previous send:","options":["Updates retroactively (dynamic)","Stays as originally sent (static)","Updates in some email clients","Requires re-send"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Previous sends are NOT affected by snippet changes. The emails that were already sent used the snippet content that was approved at send time. Only future sends will use the updated snippet. Historical send data remains unchanged - this is important for reporting accuracy."},{"q":"Global form used on 10 landing pages. Edit form: add required field \"Phone\". Impact?","options":["All 10 pages immediately require phone","Must update each page individually","Only new submissions require phone","Form breaks on all pages"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Adding a required field to a global form immediately affects ALL 10 landing pages where it's used. The change is instant upon form approval - no landing page updates needed. This is both powerful and risky - always test changes before approving global form edits."},{"q":"Trigger campaign: \"Fills Out Form X\". Person fills out Form X at 2:00 PM. When does flow execute?","options":["Immediately (real-time)","Next scheduled batch time","Within 1 hour","Next day"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Trigger campaigns fire immediately when the trigger condition is met. Person fills out Form X at 2:00 PM, so the flow begins executing at 2:00 PM (or within seconds/minutes depending on processing). This real-time execution is what distinguishes Trigger from Batch campaigns."},{"q":"Batch campaign Smart List: 1,000 people qualify at 9 AM. Campaign scheduled for 10 AM.

Person gets opportunity after Email B. Result?","options":["Receives Email C (continues)","Stops at Remove from Flow, no Email C","Receives Email C immediately (skips wait)","Pauses at Remove from Flow"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The flow executes sequentially: Send Email A, wait 3 days, send Email B. The 'Remove from Flow if Opportunity Created' step is a conditional check - if an opportunity was created before reaching that point, the person is removed. Otherwise, they continue through the flow."},{"q":"Request Campaign: Campaign A calls Campaign B. Campaign B's qualification rule: \"Once per person\". Person has run through Campaign B before via different path. When called from Campaign A:","options":["Runs again (Request Campaign overrides)","Blocked (already ran once)","Requires manual override","Creates duplicate record"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When Campaign B has 'Once per person' qualification and the same person is requested again, Campaign B won't run for them a second time. The qualification rule prevents re-entry. This protects against duplicate communications even when Request Campaign is called multiple times."},{"q":"Choice Step: Send Email","options":["CA Email (first choice)","No email (doesn't match)","General Email (default)","Error"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Choice Steps allow conditional logic in flows. The example shows: if Lead Source = Webinar, set Status to 'Webinar Lead'; otherwise set Status to 'MQL'. This branching logic enables different actions based on lead attributes without needing separate campaigns."},{"q":"Wait until {{lead.Renewal Date}}. Renewal Date = March 1. Today is March 5. Flow:","options":["Waits until next year March 1","Continues immediately (date passed)","Errors out","Pauses indefinitely"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When the wait-until date (March 1) has already passed (today is March 5), the flow continues immediately.

Marketer deactivates campaign. 3 days later, reactivates. People in wait:","options":["Start 14 days over","Continue from day 3 (11 days remaining)","Exit flow","Complete wait immediately"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When a trigger campaign is deactivated, the 50 people in Wait Steps stop processing and remain frozen. After 3 days, they are still frozen - they don't automatically continue or get removed. Reactivation is required for them to resume their flow progression."},{"q":"Qualification: \"Once every 30 days\". Person qualifies Jan 1, Jan 15, Feb 1. Runs through:","options":["Once (Jan 1 only)","Twice (Jan 1, Feb 1)","Three times (all)","Once (most recent)"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"With 'Once every 30 days': Jan 1 (runs), Jan 15 is within 30 days (skipped), Feb 1 is 31 days after Jan 1 (runs). The qualification rule creates a cooldown period that resets each time the campaign successfully processes the person."},{"q":"Batch campaign with Smart List: 5,000 people.
