const questions = [
            {q:"What determines if a Smart Campaign is Batch or Trigger?",options:["How many people qualify","Filters only = Batch; At least one trigger = Trigger","Schedule settings","Program type"],correct:[1],explanation:"The Smart List contents determine campaign type. Filters ONLY = Batch campaign. At least ONE trigger (can have filters too) = Trigger campaign. This is heavily tested!"},
            {q:"Smart Campaign has Filter: Lead Score > 50, and Trigger: Fills Out Form. What type?",options:["Batch","Trigger","Both","Neither"],correct:[1],explanation:"At least one trigger makes it a Trigger campaign, even if it also has filters. The trigger fires in real-time when someone fills out the form, then filters are checked."},
            {q:"Which finds people who clicked in the PAST?",options:["Clicks Link (trigger)","Clicked Link (filter)","Will Click Link","Link Click Activity"],correct:[1],explanation:"Past tense 'Clicked' = Filter (finds people who already clicked). Present tense 'Clicks' = Trigger (fires when someone clicks now)."},
            {q:"Which flow step should you use to notify sales when a hot lead requests a demo?",options:["Send Email","Send Alert","Create Task","Change Owner"],correct:[1],explanation:"Send Alert sends notification emails to internal stakeholders (sales reps, account managers). Send Email sends to the lead/contact themselves."},
            {q:"For Request Campaign to work, called campaign Smart List must have:",options:["Filled Out Form","Campaign is Requested","Member of List","Any trigger"],correct:[1],explanation:"Called campaign MUST have 'Campaign is Requested' trigger in Smart List. Without this, Request Campaign flow step won't work."},
            {q:"What does 'Remove from Flow' do?",options:["Deletes from database","Stops flow execution immediately for that person","Removes from list","Unsubscribes"],correct:[1],explanation:"Remove from Flow stops flow immediately. All subsequent flow steps are skipped. Person stays in database but doesn't continue through the campaign."},
            {q:"What is the MAXIMUM wait time for a Wait Step?",options:["90 days","365 days","730 days (2 years)","Unlimited"],correct:[2],explanation:"Maximum wait duration is 730 days (2 years). If you need longer, use multiple wait steps or different approach."},
            {q:"Wait until {{lead.Trial End Date}}. Trial ended yesterday. What happens?",options:["Wait fails","Waits until next year","Flow continues immediately","Person removed"],correct:[2],explanation:"If wait date has passed, flow continues immediately. Person doesn't get stuck waiting for a date in the past."},
            {q:"People in Wait Steps when you DEACTIVATE trigger campaign:",options:["Complete flow normally","Removed from campaign","Stop processing and remain in wait","Error notification sent"],correct:[2],explanation:"CRITICAL! Deactivating stops processing. People stay in Wait steps. Reactivating resumes from where they paused. This is a common exam question!"},
            {q:"Qualification rule 'Once every 7 days'. Person qualifies Monday and Wednesday. What happens?",options:["Runs both times","Only runs Monday","Only runs Wednesday","Error"],correct:[1],explanation:"7-day cooldown blocks Wednesday (too soon after Monday). Person must wait 7 days from Monday before qualifying again."},
            {q:"Default qualification rule:",options:["Every time","Once per person","Once every 7 days","Once per month"],correct:[1],explanation:"Default is 'Once per person' - person can run through the campaign one time ever. Prevents accidental duplicate processing."},
            {q:"Choice Step: Send Email - Choice 1: If State=CA send CA Email, Choice 2: If State=TX send TX Email, Default: General Email. Person in FL receives:",options:["CA Email","No email","General Email (default)","Error"],correct:[2],explanation:"FL doesn't match Choice 1 or 2, so Default executes. Default catches everyone who doesn't match specific choices."},
            {q:"Flow: Send A → Wait 3 days → Send B → Remove from Flow if Opp Created → Wait 4 days → Send C. Person gets opp after B. Result:",options:["Receives C","Stops at Remove from Flow, no C","Receives C immediately","Pauses indefinitely"],correct:[1],explanation:"Remove from Flow stops execution when condition is met. Email C doesn't send because flow stopped before the second Wait step."},
            {q:"Request Campaign: Campaign A calls Campaign B. Campaign B qualification: 'Once per person'. Person ran B before. When called from A:",options:["Runs again (Request overrides)","Blocked (already ran once)","Requires admin override","Creates duplicate record"],correct:[1],explanation:"Qualification rules still apply even via Request Campaign. If 'once per person' and already ran, person is blocked from running again."},
            {q:"Wait Step: Wait 5 days. Person enters Monday 9 AM. When do they proceed?",options:["Saturday 9 AM","Friday 9 AM","Next Monday 9 AM","Saturday midnight"],correct:[0],explanation:"5 days from Monday 9 AM = Saturday 9 AM. Wait steps maintain the time component."},
            {q:"Trigger campaign active, 50 people in 'Wait 14 days'. Deactivate campaign. 3 days later, reactivate. People in wait:",options:["Start 14 days over","Continue from day 3 (11 days remaining)","Exit flow completely","Complete immediately"],correct:[1],explanation:"Reactivating resumes wait from where they paused. They've waited 3 days, so 11 days remain. Timer doesn't reset."},
            {q:"Batch campaign recurring daily. Qualification: 'Once per person'. Day 1: 10,000 processed. Day 2:",options:["Processes 0 (all ran once)","Processes 10,000 (recurring overrides)","Only new people","Requires manual reset"],correct:[0],explanation:"'Once per person' blocks all 10,000 on Day 2 since they already ran once. Only new people who never ran would process on Day 2."},
            {q:"Flow: Change Data Value with Choice - If Score>75: Status=Hot, If Score>50: Status=Warm, Default: Cold. Person Score=60:",options:["Hot","Warm","Cold","No change"],correct:[1],explanation:"First matching choice wins. 60 is NOT >75 (Choice 1 fails), but 60 IS >50 (Choice 2 matches). Status = Warm."},
            {q:"Smart Campaign Schedule shows 'Campaign is Requested'. This campaign is:",options:["Batch manually triggered","Called via Request Campaign flow step","Trigger with special setting","Configuration error"],correct:[1],explanation:"'Campaign is Requested' in Smart List means this campaign is designed to be called by other campaigns via Request Campaign flow step."},
            {q:"Batch Smart List: 1,000 qualify at 9 AM. Campaign scheduled 10 AM. At 9:30, 100 more qualify. At 10 AM runs, how many process?",options:["1,000 (qualified at schedule time)","1,100 (all who qualify)","100 (new only)","0 (already processed)"],correct:[0],explanation:"Batch campaign Smart List locks at runtime. Processes whoever qualifies at 10 AM when it runs, not who qualified earlier."}
