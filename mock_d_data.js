const questions=[{"q":"Email Program with A/B test (Subject Line), Recipient Time Zone, scheduled 48 hours out. Can you enable Head Start?","options":["Yes, all three features work together","No, cannot use Head Start with A/B testing","Yes, but only for Click Rate winner criteria","Only if approved 72 hours in advance"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"With RTZ enabled and 48 hours advance approval, both Head Start and RTZ work together. Head Start sends to top performers 9 hours early, RTZ ensures local time delivery for the rest. The 48-hour window exceeds the 34-hour minimum (25h RTZ + 9h Head Start), so everything works correctly."},{"q":"A/B Test winner criteria \"Custom Conversion\". Test sample 20%, waiting period 24 hours. After 24 hours, conversion data shows tie (50/50). What happens?","options":["System picks randomly","Sends both versions to remaining 80%","Requires manual winner selection","Extends test period automatically"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Custom Conversion as winner criteria waits the full 24 hours regardless of sample size. After 24 hours, if neither variation reaches conversion threshold, Marketo uses the fallback metric (usually clicks or opens) to declare a winner. The winner then goes to remaining recipients."},{"q":"Engagement Program: Stream 1 has Email A (approved), Email B (draft), Email C (approved). Person already received Email A. What does the next cast send?","options":["Email B (draft)","Email C (skips draft Email B)","Nothing (stuck on draft)","Email A again"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Engagement streams skip unapproved content. Person received Email A (approved), Email B is draft so it's skipped, next cast delivers Email C (approved). The person's position advances past the draft - they don't wait for it. Email B will only be delivered if approved before the person reaches it again."},{"q":"My Token '{{my.discount}}' = \"20%\". Email subject: \"Get {{my.discount}} off!\" Person opens email, marketer immediately changes token to \"30%\" and approves. Person forwards email to colleague who opens it. Colleague sees:","options":["\"Get 20% off!\" (original)","\"Get 30% off!\" (updated token)","\"Get {{my.discount}} off!\" (token broken)","Depends on email client"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"My Tokens are program-level, not person-level. The token {{my.discount}} = '20%' is the same for ALL recipients in that program. Both Person A and Person B see '20% off' in the subject line - the token value doesn't change per person. For personalization, use lead tokens instead."},{"q":"Folder has token '{{my.region}}' = \"EMEA\". Program in folder also has '{{my.region}}' = \"AMER\". You delete the program-level token. Email in program now shows:","options":["{{my.region}} (broken)","EMEA (inherits from folder)","AMER (cached value)","Error - must define token"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Program-level tokens override folder-level tokens. The program's {{my.region}} = 'AMER' takes precedence over the folder's 'EMEA'. This hierarchy (Program > Folder) is fundamental to Marketo token behavior. It allows you to set defaults at folder level and customize per program."},{"q":"Channel with success statuses: \"Registered\" and \"Attended\". Person has status \"Registered\" (success), later changes to \"Attended\" (also success). Program Performance Report \"Success\" count:","options":["1 (counted once)","2 (counted each time)","0 (conflict)","Depends on which was first"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Having 'Registered' status means the person IS a success if 'Registered' is marked as a success status in the Channel configuration. Success status doesn't have to be the final status - any status marked as success counts. This is configurable per Channel."},{"q":"Period Cost added for \"March 2025\" with value $10,000. Program ran in April 2025. Program Performance Report for April 2025 shows cost:","options":["$10,000 (period cost assigned to program)","$0 (period cost was March, not April)","Prorated amount","Error (date mismatch)"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Period Costs are tied to specific time periods, not when the program runs. The $10,000 cost for March 2025 only appears in March reporting, even though the program ran in April. This is important for accurate monthly/quarterly ROI reporting - costs are attributed to when they were incurred."},{"q":"Engagement Program with 2 streams. Person in Stream 1, cadence=Paused. Cast happens. What is the result?","options":["Receives content from Stream 1","Receives nothing (paused)","Moves to Stream 2","Becomes exhausted"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When cadence is Paused, the person does NOT receive content even when a cast happens. They remain in their current stream position but are skipped during casting. They won't receive content until their cadence is resumed. No content is permanently skipped."},{"q":"Email Program approved with schedule \"Tomorrow 9 AM\". At tomorrow 8:55 AM, you abort. Result:","options":["Send cancelled successfully","Too late - already processing (if using Head Start)","Sends anyway (cannot abort)","Queues for next day"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Aborting at 8:55 AM (5 minutes before scheduled send) prevents the email from being sent. The program returns to a state where it can be rescheduled. However, if any emails were already queued for delivery in those last minutes, they may still go out - timing matters at the margins."},{"q":"Communication limit: 1/day. Person receives Marketing Email A at 9 AM (counts toward limit). At 11 AM, Smart Campaign tries to send Marketing Email B. What happens to Email B?","options":["Blocked (limit reached)","Sent (different campaign)","Queued for tomorrow","Sent if score > 50"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Communication limit is 1/day. Person already received Marketing Email A (counts as 1). Operational Email B does NOT count toward the limit - operational emails are exempt from communication limits. So the person receives Email B regardless of the daily limit being reached."},{"q":"What does a cloned Email Program retain from the original?","options":["A/B test configuration","Approved status","My Tokens","Schedule/send time"],"correct":[0,2],"multiple":true,"explanation":"When cloning an Email Program, it retains: the A/B test configuration AND the email assets (as drafts). However, tokens values, schedules, and approval status are NOT retained - they need to be set up fresh in the cloned program. Smart Lists are also not cloned automatically."},{"q":"Token '{{lead.First Name}}' with no default. Field is NULL (not empty string). What does the email show?","options":["Nothing (blank space)","{{lead.First Name}}","NULL","[No Name]"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When a lead token field is NULL (not just empty string), the raw token {{lead.First Name}} appears as literal text in the email. NULL and empty string are different - NULL means no value exists at all. Always use :default= syntax to handle both NULL and empty cases gracefully."},{"q":"Smart Campaign calls itself via Request Campaign (recursive). What happens?","options":["Works fine","Infinite loop until manually stopped","Marketo prevents recursion","Processes once only"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Recursive Request Campaign (calling itself) creates an infinite loop. Marketo has built-in protection - it will detect the recursion and stop execution after the first call. The person only goes through the campaign once. This prevents infinite loops from crashing your automation."},{"q":"Event Program linked to GoToWebinar. 100 register via Marketo, 50 via GoToWebinar directly. What does Program Members show?","options":["100 (Marketo only)","150 (both)","50 (GoToWebinar only)","Sync conflict error"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"GoToWebinar integration syncs registration data bidirectionally. The 50 people who registered directly on GoToWebinar are synced to Marketo as Event Program members with 'Registered' status. Total registered = 150 (100 Marketo + 50 GoToWebinar). Both sources are consolidated."},{"q":"Smart List Filter \"Clicked Link\" + Constraint \"Link contains 'pricing'\". Person clicked: \"https://yoursite.com/pricing-page\". Match?","options":["Yes","No (must be exact match)","Yes if case-insensitive","Depends on settings"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The constraint 'Link contains pricing' narrows which clicks count. The person clicked pricing.html (matches) and careers.html (doesn't match). Only the pricing click counts for this filter. Constraints are critical - they modify the base filter to be more specific."},{"q":"Segmentation order: (1) VIP (custom field VIP=true), (2) High Value (Annual Revenue>$1M), (3) Default. Person: VIP=true AND Annual Revenue=$2M. Which segment?","options":["VIP (first match)","High Value","Both","Default (conflicts)"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Segmentations are evaluated top-to-bottom. VIP=true is checked first. Even though this person also has Annual Revenue > $1M (High Value), they're assigned to VIP because it's the first matching segment. Segment priority is determined entirely by position order."},{"q":"Import 1,000 records. 900 match existing (by email), 100 new. Import type \"Update People Only\". Result:","options":["Updates 900, creates 100","Updates 900, skips 100","Creates 100, skips 900","Error - conflicting data"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Update People Only' only updates existing records - it does NOT create new ones. The 100 new records are simply ignored/skipped. Only the 900 matching existing records get updated. If you needed those 100 new records created, you'd need 'New People and Updates' instead."},{"q":"Person has Email=\"test@example.com\". You delete person. Later, import same email. Result:","options":["Error (email exists)","Creates new record (deletion cleared email)","Restores deleted record","Requires admin override"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Deleting a person permanently removes them from Marketo. When you later import the same email, a completely NEW record is created. There is no 'trash' or recovery - deleted records are gone. The new record has no history from the previous one."},{"q":"Global Form Validation blocks \"@gmail.com\". Form on LP has field \"Work Email\" (mapped to Email Address). Person enters \"john@gmail.com\". Result:","options":["Blocked (validation applies to field mapping)","Allowed (field name doesn't matter)","Warning shown but allowed","Depends on form type"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Global Form Validation Rules check the Email Address field specifically. Even though the form field is labeled 'Work Email', if it's mapped to the Email Address field in Marketo, the validation rule applies. The rule checks the underlying mapped field, not the label."},{"q":"Smart List: NOT Member of List \"Customers\" AND Lead Score > 50. List \"Customers\" has 1,000 people. Database has 100,000 total. How many possible matches?","options":["1,000","99,000 (NOT customers)","Depends on how many of 99,000 have score > 50","Cannot calculate"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"The Smart List finds people who are NOT in the Customers list AND have Lead Score > 50. From 10,000 people, subtract 1,000 customers = 9,000 non-customers. Of those 9,000, the ones with Lead Score > 50 qualify. The NOT operator excludes the entire Customer list first."},{"q":"Segmentation approved. Need to change Default segment filters (currently no filters). What is the process?","options":["Edit directly (Default is special)","Unapprove → Edit → Re-approve","Cannot edit Default","Default has no filters by definition"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"To edit the Default segment: create a draft of the Segmentation, modify the Default segment filters, then approve. Even though Default typically has no filters (catch-all), you can add filters if needed. The draft/approve process protects active Dynamic Content."},{"q":"Person: Unsubscribed=True, Blocklisted=False. Marketer changes Unsubscribed=False (re-subscribes them). Compliant?","options":["Yes, marketer can re-subscribe","No, only person can change Unsubscribed (legal issue)","Yes if documented","Requires admin approval"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Re-subscribing (setting Unsubscribed=False) reactivates marketing emails for that person. They can now receive marketing communications again. This is a valid action - people can opt back in. The change takes effect immediately for future sends."},{"q":"Static List \"Event Attendees\" has 200 people. You delete the list. People:","options":["Deleted from database","Remain in database (list deleted, not people)","Moved to \"Deleted Lists\" folder","Require manual cleanup"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Deleting a Static List removes the LIST, not the people in it. All 200 people remain in your Marketo database with their full history intact. They just lose their membership in that specific list. This is an important distinction - list deletion ≠ record deletion."},{"q":"Smart List in Program A references \"Member of Program B\". Program B is deleted. Smart List:","options":["Breaks/errors","Returns 0 results (no one in deleted program)","Auto-updates to remove filter","Keeps historical data"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When Program B is deleted, the Smart List in Program A that references 'Member of Program B' breaks. The filter becomes invalid because the referenced program no longer exists. The Smart List will either show an error or return no results for that filter condition."},{"q":"Field \"Lead Score\" changed from 45 to 55 at 2:00 PM. Smart List filter \"Lead Score > 50\" run at 3:00 PM. Includes person?","options":["Yes (current score is 55)","No (was 45 when filter created)","Maybe (depends on sync)","Need to refresh Smart List"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Smart Lists update dynamically. When Lead Score changed from 45 to 55 at 2:00 PM, the person immediately qualifies for 'Lead Score > 50'. Smart Lists re-evaluate in real-time, so this person appears in the list right away. This is the key advantage of Smart Lists over Static Lists."},{"q":"You want \"Contains\" filter case-insensitive. \"Job Title contains 'director'\" should match \"Director\", \"DIRECTOR\", \"director\". Does it?","options":["Yes (Marketo filters are case-insensitive)","No (case-sensitive by default)","Only with advanced filter","Requires admin setting"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Marketo's 'contains' filter IS case-insensitive by default. 'Job Title contains director' matches 'Director', 'DIRECTOR', 'director', 'VP of Direction', etc. You don't need any special configuration - case-insensitivity is built into the contains operator."},{"q":"Segmentation with 1 segment + Default. You delete the 1 segment. Where does everyone go?","options":["Default (only option left)","No segment (broken)","Error (need minimum 2 segments)","Cannot delete last segment"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When you delete the only non-Default segment, everyone falls into Default. The Default segment is the catch-all - with no other segments to match, every person automatically belongs to Default. Dynamic Content will show the Default variation to everyone."},{"q":"Person in \"All People\" System Smart List. Also appears in \"Blocklisted\" System Smart List. Contradiction?","options":["Yes - error","No - \"All People\" includes everyone, even blocklisted","Database corrupted","Need to refresh"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"A person can appear in multiple System Smart Lists simultaneously. Being in 'All People' AND 'Blocklisted' is normal - All People contains everyone regardless of status. System Smart Lists are not mutually exclusive like Segmentation segments."},{"q":"Approved email used in active trigger campaign. You delete the email. What happens to the campaign?","options":["Breaks immediately","Continues with cached version","Auto-pauses","Sends blank email"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Deleting an approved email that's used in an active trigger campaign causes the campaign to fail for future triggers. The campaign can no longer send because the email asset no longer exists. Existing sends already completed are unaffected, but new triggers will error."},{"q":"Form Pre-Fill on Marketo LP. Person has First Name=\"John\". Form field labeled \"Your First Name\" (mapped to First Name). Pre-fills?","options":["Yes (mapping matters, not label)","No (label mismatch)","Only if label exactly matches","Requires admin setting"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Form Pre-Fill maps by field, not by label. The field labeled 'Your First Name' is mapped to the 'First Name' field in Marketo. Since the person has First Name='John', it pre-fills regardless of what the form label says. Pre-Fill works on the underlying field mapping."},{"q":"Progressive Profiling: Pool has fields A, B, C, D, E. Set to show 2. Person has B and D. What do they see?","options":["A and C (next in order, skipping B and D)","B and D (shows what they have)","Random 2","All 5 (overrides when person has data)"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Progressive Profiling shows unfilled fields. Person has B and D filled. From pool (A,B,C,D,E), unfilled fields are A, C, E. With show=2, the form displays fields A and C (the first 2 unfilled fields in order). B and D are hidden since they're already filled."},{"q":"Form Visibility Rule: \"If Field A = 'Yes', show Field B\". Person answers 'Yes', sees Field B, leaves it blank, submits. Validation?","options":["Error if Field B is required","Allowed (hidden fields don't validate)","Depends on browser","Form resets"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Visibility Rules can chain but the second rule depends on the first. Field B appears when A='Yes'. If Field B's value then triggers another rule to show Field C, that works - but only if B is visible and has a value. Dynamic visibility cascades based on current form state."},{"q":"Snippet \"Header\" has dynamic content (3 segments). Used in email with different segmentation (5 segments). Result:","options":["Error (conflict)","Snippet uses its own segmentation (3 segments)","Email overrides snippet","Uses combination (15 variations)"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Snippets with dynamic content use their OWN Segmentation, independent of the email's Segmentation. If the snippet uses 'Region' segmentation and the email uses 'Industry' segmentation, they operate independently. Each person sees the snippet variation matching their Region segment."},{"q":"Operational Email setting: Unsubscribed=Ignore, Blocklisted=Respect. Person is both Unsubscribed AND Blocklisted. What do they receive?","options":["Email (operational ignores both)","No email (Blocklisted blocks all)","Depends on which was set first","Requires manual send"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Operational emails respect Blocklisted status even with 'Ignore Unsubscribed' setting. The settings are independent: Unsubscribed is ignored (email sends despite unsubscribe), but Blocklisted is respected (email is blocked). Person is Blocklisted, so the email is NOT sent."},{"q":"Preheader uses '{{lead.Company}}' token. Person's Company field has 200 characters. What does the preheader display?","options":["Full 200 characters","Truncated ~40-100 characters (email client limits)","Error (too long)","Token fails"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Email preheader has a character limit (varies by email client, typically 40-100 chars). A 200-character Company name gets truncated in the preheader preview. Only the first portion displays. This is a data quality issue - consider using :default= or truncating long values."},{"q":"Landing Page URL: \"info.company.com/offer\". Page is approved. URL is:","options":["Immediately live","Live after 24 hours","Live after DNS propagation","Requires manual publish"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"An approved landing page URL is active and accessible immediately. Anyone with the URL can visit the page. The URL format is typically subdomain.yourdomain.com/page-name. Once approved, no additional steps are needed to make it live and accessible."},{"q":"Email sent with Text Only=No. Recipient's email client blocks images. What happens to open tracking?","options":["Works (JavaScript backup)","Fails (needs image pixel)","Partial (50% accurate)","Requires retry"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Text Only=No means the email includes HTML with tracking pixel. Even if the recipient's email client blocks images, the open tracking pixel may still fire depending on client settings. Some clients load images by default; others require user permission. Tracking is not 100% reliable."},{"q":"Email has CC={{lead.Sales Rep Email}}. Field is empty. What happens to the email?","options":["Sends with no CC","Sends CC to \"{{lead.Sales Rep Email}}\"","Fails (invalid CC)","CC to sender"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When CC field token is empty, the email still sends - it just has no CC recipient. Marketo doesn't fail on empty CC tokens. The email goes to the primary recipient (To field) without any CC. This is graceful handling of missing optional data."},{"q":"Engagement Program: Person is member with Normal cadence. Also member of nurture smart campaign sending same emails. What happens on next cast?","options":["Receives from both (duplicate)","Engagement program prevents duplicate","Smart campaign blocks engagement","Random selection"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Engagement Program membership and Smart Campaign membership are independent. Being in both doesn't cause conflicts. The Engagement Program manages nurture cadence, while the Smart Campaign runs its own logic independently. Both can send emails to the same person (subject to communication limits)."},{"q":"Global Form on 5 landing pages. Form has CAPTCHA enabled. One landing page wants CAPTCHA off. What is the solution?","options":["Disable globally (affects all 5)","Clone form, disable CAPTCHA, use on that page (local form)","Override per page","Not possible"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"CAPTCHA is a global form setting - you can't enable/disable it per landing page. If CAPTCHA is enabled on the form, it appears on ALL landing pages using that form. To have CAPTCHA on some pages but not others, you'd need separate forms (one with CAPTCHA, one without)."},{"q":"Email has 2 dynamic sections: Header (Region segmentation) and Footer (Language segmentation). Person in \"AMER\" region and \"English\" language. Sees:","options":["Error (can't use 2 segmentations)","AMER header + English footer (both work)","Only header dynamic","Must choose one"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Multiple dynamic sections in one email work independently. The Header uses Region segmentation and Footer uses Language segmentation. Each section evaluates its own Segmentation independently. A person sees their Region-matched header AND their Language-matched footer - mixing and matching correctly."},{"q":"Snippet approved. Email approved using snippet. Snippet draft created, edited. What does the email show?","options":["Snippet draft (dynamic)","Last approved snippet (static)","Error (snippet in draft)","Blank space"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Snippet drafts don't affect emails using the approved snippet version. The email continues showing the approved snippet content. Only when you approve the new snippet draft will emails (on future sends) show the updated content. Current approved version remains stable."},{"q":"Form has 10 fields, all visible, all marked required. Known person visits, Pre-Fill populates all 10. They change 1 field. What does submit validate?","options":["Only changed field","All 10 fields (required=always validate)","None (pre-filled = trusted)","Browser dependent"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Pre-Fill populates required fields automatically. Even though all 10 fields are required, Pre-Fill fills the known ones (like Email, Name). The person only needs to manually fill the fields that aren't pre-filled. Required validation only triggers on fields the person needs to complete."},{"q":"Dynamic Content: Email to person in segment \"EMEA\". After send queued but before delivery, person moves to \"AMER\" segment. Receives:","options":["EMEA (segment at queue time)","AMER (segment at delivery)","Default (segment changed)","Email fails"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Once an email is queued for sending, the content is locked in at that point. Even if the person's segment changes after the send is queued but before delivery, they receive the AMER content that was determined when the email was queued. Queue-time snapshot is final."},{"q":"Email Program with A/B test. Version A: 50 characters subject. Version B: 100 characters subject. Winner criteria: Open Rate. Which likely wins?","options":["A (shorter subjects perform better typically)","B (more information)","Equal","Cannot predict"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"A/B test subject line length can vary between versions. Version A (50 chars) and Version B (100 chars) are both valid - Marketo doesn't enforce matching lengths. However, longer subject lines may be truncated in some email clients, potentially affecting performance differently across versions."},{"q":"Draft email has broken image link. You approve anyway. Campaign sends email. What do recipients see?","options":["Broken image icon","Email fails to send","Image auto-corrects","Email sends without image"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Approving an email with a broken image link sends it as-is. Recipients see a broken image placeholder (typically an X or blank space). Marketo doesn't validate image links before sending. Always preview and test emails thoroughly before approving - broken assets can't be recalled."},{"q":"Form embedded on external site (yoursite.com). Known visitor. Pre-Fill works?","options":["Yes","No (security - only Marketo domains)","Yes if same company","With CORS header"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Form Pre-Fill does NOT work on external websites, regardless of whether the visitor is known. Pre-Fill only works on Marketo-hosted landing pages. External sites cannot access Marketo's lead database to populate form fields. This is a fundamental platform limitation."},{"q":"Person exhausted in Stream 1. You add new email to Stream 1. What happens on next cast?","options":["Still exhausted (already processed stream)","Receives new email (no longer exhausted)","Needs manual reset","Requires stream transition"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"When a person is exhausted (received all content) and you add new content to their stream, they receive it on the next cast. The 'exhausted' status is automatically cleared when new content is added. This allows you to extend nurture sequences without creating new programs."},{"q":"Landing page template has form placeholder. You create page from template, add form, approve. Edit template to change form position. What happens to the existing page?","options":["Updates automatically","Unchanged (pages are independent after creation)","Requires re-approval","Breaks"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Landing pages created from templates inherit the template structure. The form placeholder is replaced with the actual form when added. Once the page is approved with the form, it's fully functional. The template provides the layout; you customize the content and assets."},{"q":"Trigger: \"Fills Out Form\". Person fills out form while trigger campaign is inactive. Later, campaign is activated. Person:","options":["Enters flow retroactively","Doesn't enter (wasn't active when they filled)","Depends on qualification rule","Enters if within 24 hours"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Trigger campaigns only fire when the trigger occurs while the campaign is ACTIVE. If the person filled the form while the campaign was inactive, that trigger event is missed - it's not retroactive. When you reactivate, only NEW form fills will trigger the campaign."},{"q":"Batch campaign Smart List: Member of Program \"Webinar\". While campaign is running (processing 1,000 people), 100 more join program. Final count processed:","options":["1,000 (Smart List locked at start)","1,100 (dynamically includes new)","100 (only new)","Error (list changed mid-run)"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Batch campaigns process their Smart List as a snapshot at run time. People added to the qualifying program DURING processing are not included in the current run - they'll be picked up on the next scheduled run. The Smart List is evaluated once at the start of each batch run."},{"q":"Flow: Send Email A → Wait 5 days → Request Campaign X → Send Email B. Campaign X takes 2 hours to process. What is the total time from start to Email B?","options":["5 days","5 days 2 hours","5 days (Request is instant, Email B sends immediately after)","7 days"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Request Campaign is a flow step, not a wait. After Campaign X executes (2 hours), flow continues to Send Email B. The total time from Send Email A to Send Email B is: 5 days (wait) + 2 hours (Campaign X execution). Request Campaign blocks the flow until the called campaign completes."},{"q":"Person in Wait Step \"Wait 10 days\". After 7 days, you change wait to \"Wait 3 days\". Person:","options":["Completes original 10 days (locked in)","Completes 3 days total (change applies)","Restarts 3 days (14 total)","Exits flow (conflict)"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Changing a Wait Step duration while people are already waiting does NOT retroactively apply to them. The person entered with 'Wait 10 days' and has been waiting 7 days. The change to 'Wait 3 days' applies only to NEW entries. This person still waits the original 10 days total."},{"q":"Smart Campaign calls itself as last step (Request Campaign → self). Qualification: \"Every time\". What happens?","options":["Infinite loop (danger!)","Marketo prevents self-reference","Runs once (ignores self-call)","Requires admin override"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Self-referencing Request Campaign with 'Every time' qualification creates a loop, but Marketo's built-in recursion protection stops it. The campaign runs once per trigger, then the self-request is blocked to prevent infinite recursion. The person goes through exactly once per initial trigger."},{"q":"Remove from Flow with Choice: \"If Opportunity exists\". Person gets opportunity during Wait Step (before reaching Remove from Flow). Result:","options":["Immediately removed (Marketo checks in real-time)","Continues wait, removed when reaching step","Skips remove (already in wait)","Wait resets"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"'Remove from Flow' with a Choice evaluates at the step's position in the flow. If the person gets an opportunity DURING a Wait Step before the Remove step, the condition is checked when they reach that step. Since the opportunity now exists, they are removed from the flow at that point."},{"q":"Choice Step: Change Score","options":["+25 (first match wins)","+40 (both match)","+15 (last match)","Error (multiple matches)"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Choice Steps evaluate conditions and route accordingly. The example shows score change logic with branching: different score adjustments based on specific conditions. If no choice matches, the default (base) action executes. Choices are evaluated in order - first match wins."},{"q":"Request Campaign called 5 times simultaneously (5 people fill form). Called campaign qualification: \"Once every 7 days\". How many times does it run?","options":["Once (first person triggers, others blocked)","5 times (once per person - qualification is per person, not per campaign)","Random","Error (overload)"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Request Campaign processes each person independently and simultaneously. All 5 people can be processed at the same time if the called campaign's qualification rule allows it. 'Once per person' means each person can enter once - all 5 are different people, so all 5 are processed."},{"q":"Wait until {{lead.Trial Start Date}}. Field has invalid date format \"March 15\". Result:","options":["Waits forever (can't parse)","Continues immediately (invalid = skip)","Error notification","Uses current date"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Invalid date format in a token causes the Wait Step to fail gracefully. 'March 15' without a year is not a valid date format. The person remains stuck in the Wait Step indefinitely until the date field is corrected to a valid format (e.g., '03/15/2025'). Monitor Wait Steps for stuck records."},{"q":"Batch campaign recurring daily. Qualification: \"Once per person\". Database has 10,000 people. Day 1: processes 10,000. Day 2:","options":["Processes 0 (all already ran once)","Processes 10,000 (recurring overrides)","Only new people","Requires manual reset"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"With 'Once per person' qualification on a daily recurring batch: each person only processes once, ever. After Day 1, some people qualify and are processed. On Day 2, those same people are skipped (already processed). New people who qualify are processed. Over time, everyone gets processed exactly once."},{"q":"Flow has 5 steps. Between steps 3 and 4, someone deletes step 3. What happens to people in flow?","options":["Error at step 3","Skip to step 4 (steps renumber)","Exit flow","Pause for review"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Deleting a flow step mid-execution: people who already passed step 3 continue normally to step 4. People currently IN step 3 are moved forward (step is gone). People who haven't reached step 3 yet skip it entirely. The flow adjusts dynamically to the deletion."},{"q":"Email: Opened=3,000, Clicked=900. Person opens 3 times, clicks 2 links. How are they counted?","options":["3 opens, 2 clicks","1 open, 1 click (unique person)","1 open, 2 clicks (unique person, multiple clicks)","Depends on tracking settings"],"correct":[2],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Opens and clicks are counted uniquely per person per email send. Even if a person opens 3 times, it counts as 1 open. Even if they click 2 different links, it counts as 1 click (unique click). Marketo tracks unique interactions, not total interactions, for standard metrics."},{"q":"Program Performance: 2 programs, both 50% success rate. Program A: 100 members. Program B: 10 members. What is the combined Success % in report?","options":["50% (average)","48% (weighted: 55 success ÷ 110 total)","52%","Cannot combine"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Success rate alone doesn't tell the full story. Program A: 100 members, 50% success = 50 successes. Program B: 1,000 members, 50% success = 500 successes. Program B generated 10x more successes despite the same rate. Both rate AND volume matter for ROI evaluation."},{"q":"Email Link Performance Report: 5 links in email. Link 1 clicked 100 times by 80 people. What does the report show?","options":["100 clicks, 80 unique","80 clicks (unique only)","100 clicks (total only)","Depends on report settings"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Link Performance tracks both total clicks and unique clicks. Link 1: 100 total clicks by 80 unique people means some people clicked it multiple times. The report shows both metrics. Unique clicks (80) is typically more meaningful for measuring reach; total clicks (100) shows engagement depth."},{"q":"Campaign Activity Report: Trigger campaign shows \"Total People Processed = 5,000\" but \"Batch Run Count = 0\". Explanation:","options":["Error (triggers don't show run count)","Correct (triggers don't have \"runs\", they process continuously)","Database issue","Need to refresh"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Campaign Activity shows 'Total People Processed' for trigger campaigns (real-time, no batch runs). The 'Batch Run Count = 0' confirms this is a trigger campaign - trigger campaigns don't have batch runs. Total Processed accumulates over time as triggers fire."},{"q":"Report Subscription: Daily, 9 AM EST. DST starts (clocks forward 1 hour). When is the next send?","options":["9 AM EDT (follows timezone)","8 AM EDT (absolute time)","10 AM EDT (offset)","Skipped (DST day)"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Report Subscriptions use the configured time (9 AM EST). When DST starts, the subscription still sends at 9 AM EST (which is now 10 AM EDT). The subscription time is tied to the timezone specified, not the clock. EST remains EST regardless of DST changes."},{"q":"Smart List Subscription: Runs 5 PM Friday. Smart List filter: \"Created in past 7 days\". Person created 5:01 PM (1 minute after). Included?","options":["Yes (within 7 days when email received)","No (Smart List snapshot at 5:00 PM)","Depends on processing time","Included next week"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Smart List Subscription captures a snapshot at send time. Person created Thursday (within 7 days), subscription runs Friday 5 PM - person IS included. The 'Created in past 7 days' filter is evaluated at the exact moment the subscription runs, not at any other time."},{"q":"Program Performance Report filters: Channel=\"Webinar\" OR Channel=\"Event\". Shows:","options":["Programs matching either (union)","Programs matching both (intersection)","Error (can't use OR)","Random selection"],"correct":[0],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Program Performance Report channel filters use AND logic by default when multiple filters are applied. To show both Webinar AND Event channels, you need to use OR logic (if available) or run separate reports. Single filter selections show only that specific channel."},{"q":"People Performance Report grouped by \"Acquisition Program\". Person acquired by Program A (deleted). Report shows:","options":["[Deleted Program]","Program A (keeps historical data)","\"Unknown\"","Error (missing data)"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"People Performance tracks acquisition program permanently. Even though the person later participated in Program B, their acquisition program remains Program A (where they were first acquired). Acquisition is a one-time attribution - it doesn't change with subsequent program participation."},{"q":"Email sent Monday. Report run Tuesday shows Open Rate=20%. Same report Wednesday shows=25% (same email send). What is the explanation?","options":["Error (shouldn't change)","Normal (people still opening over time)","Cache issue","Report corrupted"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Open Rate can increase over time after send because opens continue to occur as people read emails later. Tuesday's 20% reflects opens up to that point; Wednesday's 25% includes additional opens that happened overnight or the next day. Reports show cumulative opens, not real-time snapshots."},{"q":"Landing Page Performance: Page has 2 forms (Form A and Form B). Person submits Form A, then Form B. \"Form Fills\" count:","options":["1 (one person)","2 (two submissions)","1 (one form per page limit)","Error (duplicate)"],"correct":[1],"multiple":false,"explanation":"Form Fills counts each individual form submission, not unique people. One person submitting Form A and then Form B counts as 2 form fills. Landing Page Performance tracks submissions at the form level, not the visitor level. This is important for understanding conversion metrics accurately on pages with multiple forms."}];
